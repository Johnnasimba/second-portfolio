               <p>My name is John Nasimba. I am a passionate full-stack web developer living in Cape Town, South Africa. I was born in Malawi in 1997. </p>

               <p>I have been developing web applications since 2019. I teach myself new skills every day by taking courses online to advance my knowledge in the field of programming. I also develop complex web applications as I am a fun believer in practice makes perfect.</p>

               <p>I went to Lilongwe University Of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) where I studied bachelor's degree in Agriculture. While growing up, my passion was to be a software engineer thatâ€™s why I switched to software development. </p>

               <p>My friends would describe me as a fast learner, hard-working, passionate, motivated, reliable, and highly productive person.</p>
